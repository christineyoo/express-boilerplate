# express-boilerplate

This is boilerplate code for creating an Express application

This is a boilerplate project that
- installs dependencies
- installs middleware appropriate for any API project
- adds basic configuration management
- configures testing libraries
- creates NPM scripts for running, developing, testing, and deploying
- creates a "Hello, world!" endpoint so we can verify that the boilerplate setup worked.
